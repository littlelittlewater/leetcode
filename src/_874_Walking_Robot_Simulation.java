/**
 * A robot on an infinite grid starts at point (0, 0) and faces north.
 * The robot can receive one of three possible types of commands:
 * -2: turn left 90 degrees
 * -1: turn right 90 degrees
 * 1 <= x <= 9: move forward x units
 * Some of the grid squares are obstacles.
 * The i-th obstacle is at grid point (obstacles[i][0], obstacles[i][1])
 * If the robot would try to move onto them,
 * the robot stays on the previous grid square instead (but still continues following the rest of the route.)
 * Return the square of the maximum Euclidean distance that the robot will be from the origin.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: commands = [4,-1,3], obstacles = []
 * Output: 25
 * Explanation: robot will go to (3, 4)
 * Example 2:
 * Input: commands = [4,-1,4,-2,4], obstacles = [[2,4]]
 * Output: 65
 * Explanation: robot will be stuck at (1, 4) before turning left and going to (1, 8)
 * Note:
 * 0 <= commands.length <= 10000
 * 0 <= obstacles.length <= 10000
 * -30000 <= obstacle[i][0] <= 30000
 * -30000 <= obstacle[i][1] <= 30000
 * The answer is guaranteed to be less than 2 ^ 31.
